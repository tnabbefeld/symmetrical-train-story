There once was a train named John who lived on the island of Trainington.  He was beatiful train, very... symmetrical.
He was the envy of all the other trains on the island.  Sometimes the trains would be so jealous they would try to 
hurt John to make him ugly, and disproportionate.

One instance of train on train violence against John was when he pulled into the train station in the nearby island of Trainville.
He "choo choo"'d his was into the station, only to realize that there was paint on the rails!  This paint colored his wheels all shades
of blue!  Nobody likes blue wheels on a train!
