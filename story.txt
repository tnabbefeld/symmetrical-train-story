There once was a train named John who lived on the island of Trainington.  He was beatiful train, very... symmetrical.
He was the envy of all the other trains on the island.  Sometimes the trains would be so jealous they would try to 
hurt John to make him ugly, and disproportionate.

One instance of train on train violence against John was when he pulled into the train station in the nearby island of Trainville.
He "choo choo"'d his was into the station, only to realize that there was paint on the rails!  This paint colored his wheels all shades
of blue!  Nobody likes blue wheels on a train!

John cried for five days and five nights.  He has never been so sad.  An old train came by and told him to man up.  The old train was
the hero of the train islands who had fought off the invading semis by hitting them off of the streets without stopping.  His body
had many bumbs, bruises, and other disfigurations but no train cared -- he was a hero.
